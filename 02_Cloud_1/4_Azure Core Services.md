# Azure Core Services

You can consider this document as a sort of guide to your AZ-900 certification. It includes the services that you need to know in a bit more detail. This document also describes how to handle the other services that you may encounter in the (practice) exam.

There are many services in Azure, but some are more important than others. Azure mentions the following architectural components and services that you should have a reasonably in-depth understanding of what they do:

- Regions and Region Pairs
- Availability Zones
- Resource Groups
- Subscriptions
- Management Groups
- Azure Resource Manager
- Virtual Machines
- Azure App Services
- Azure Container Instances (ACI)
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Azure Virtual Desktop
- Virtual Networks
- VPN Gateway
- Virtual Network Peering
- ExpressRoute
- Container (Blob) Storage
- Disk Storage
- File Storage
- Storage Tiers
- Cosmos DB
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Database for MySQL
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- SQL Managed Instance
- Azure Marketplace

Of course, there are many more services that may appear in your exam. For these services, it is sufficient to be familiar with the product page (see here an example of an Azure product page).

In addition to the services, you can also expect questions about various cloud concepts, such as High Availability, the consumption-based pricing model, and the shared responsibility model.
