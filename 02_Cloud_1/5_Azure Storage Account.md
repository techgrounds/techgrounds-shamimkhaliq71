# Azure Storage Account

To store data in Azure, you need an Azure Storage Account. A Storage Account contains all Azure Storage data objects such as blobs, files, disks, and tables.

Data in a Storage Account is secure, highly available, durable, and massively scalable. All data in a Storage Account is accessible over the internet using HTTP and HTTPS. Because it is easily accessible, it is important to ensure that only the appropriate identities have permissions to access the data.

Azure Storage Explorer is a free GUI tool for managing your data in Azure.

Many Azure IaaS and PaaS services also utilize Azure Storage Accounts.

In addition to data storage, Blob Storage can also be used for hosting static websites.
