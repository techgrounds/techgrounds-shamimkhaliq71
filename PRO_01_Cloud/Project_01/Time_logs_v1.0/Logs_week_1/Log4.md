Daily report

- Made the choice to use Azure CLI and tried to set that as default commandline.
- Continued with learning modules


Obstacles:

- Systems are set up, I just need to understand how everything will work together.
- When opening a new terminal, I couldn't see a choice for Azure CLI to set that as my default command line.
- After going through Microsoft documenst and putting my question in Chatgpt, I still couldn't solve the issue.
- Still feeling all over the place and cannot focus on anything today.


Solutions:

- Take one step at a time.
- Asked a colleague, but he also couldn't find a solution, till we both figured, that it was just powershell(pwsh) from which we use Azure CLI.
