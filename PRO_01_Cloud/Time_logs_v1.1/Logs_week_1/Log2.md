Daily report

Created new folders for V1.1 and read through the new requirements.
Worked on V1.0 and tried to complete it today

Obstacles:

Webserver was still not connecting with webpage


Solutions:

Checked with colleagues and ChatGPT.
Figured out myself that port HTTP 80 needed to be open for traffic to be allowed through.
Added the port via Azure and it worked, using Apache I was able to conect with the webpage
