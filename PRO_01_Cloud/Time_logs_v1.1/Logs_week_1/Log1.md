Daily report

Continued to work on V1.0 and tried to get all errors out my resource scripts and have it ready for v1.1


Obstacles:

Everything was succefully deployed and was working fine except the connection from the Webserver to the webpage.
And I didn't remember how to use the RDP, so went back to the first few weeks of class to check and refresh my memory about Apache2 assignment.


Solutions:

Work in progress, do not give up and check more resources. Also Tim is scrummaster now and he has been given permission to asit me more where needed.
