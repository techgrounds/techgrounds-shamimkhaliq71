Daily report

Created a new File for a VMScaleset.
Now adding other resources, such as AppGateWay, NSGs, Vnet, autoscaleHost, IP

Not focussing on the certificates yet.

Fingers crossed, that it works. 
Have been watching a really good youtube  video to understand the relationship between all these resources

Solution

After hitting several errors, I finally managed to deploy everything successfully.
