Daily report

New day, started much more relaxed and happy.

Added some logs of the last week

Continued to watch the youtube video about AppGateWay to understand the relationship between all the related resources and get a better understanding about the choices I make and why

Also added the health probe to my AppGw_VMss template and removed public IP from the Webserver_v1.1 template, deployed it all again via Main_v1.1 file and it was a success. Tim, check it with me and tha AppGateWay is connected proerly to my Webserver and the Public IP of the AppGw in the Webbrouwser takes me to the Apache webpage.

Super happy and proud of myself!!
