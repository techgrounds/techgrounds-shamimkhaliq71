Daily report:

Good start of the week. Continueing with the modules in MS Learn and watching videos that go with those modules to get a better understanding of things.

Obstacles:

At the end of the day, I tried to run s test script in bash terminal, but I couldn't, because my Azure account wasn't connected to the terminal and I was not able to change that.

Solutions:

Checked every option of what could be the reason and how to fix this problem. Evn checked in Chatgpt. But no luck. 
Called it a day after trouble shooting for a few hours. Tomorrow is a new day...I will try again.
