Daily report:

New day, fresh start!

MS Learn modules and relating videos, testing to create a resource group and storage account and deploy to Azure. all went well, after correcting some errors.

Good news, I got the job at Rapid Circle!! So happy so proud. Even more motivated now to get this project right.


Obstacles:

Facing a electric outage today, Liander try to sort it out, but it took them most of the day, so not been able to do much work today.

Solutions:

To myself: Do not panic and stay calm!

In evening when electric was back and everyhing was up and running again, I watched the rest of the video of MS learn module 2, made a start with 3 and updated some files.
