Daily report

I was feeling very tired today. It has not been a very productive day.
Completing MS module 3 (Build reusable Bicep templates by using parameters)

Obstacles:

Just couldn't focus on anything today, foggy brain was playing up again.
Lots of squilly line in my script. Just going through eachone to fix the error, to be able to deploy.

Solutions:

Finally at the end of the day managed to get rid of all the squilly lines in my script.
Good way to end the week!

Staying positive, I still have two weeks till deadline of v1.0. 
Will put in extra hours over the weekend to catch up.
