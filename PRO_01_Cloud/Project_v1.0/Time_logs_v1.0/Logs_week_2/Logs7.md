Daily report

Stared a fresh day witha determind mindset to fix yesterdays problem and continue the MS modules.


Obstacles:

Created a new bicep file and created a script following instructions in Module 2. Tried to run the script in bash terminal, but wasn't letting me, beacuse I couldn't login onto my Azure portal via the terminal. Aparently, my account wasn't recognized which didn't allow me to login to the Azure portal, therefor I couldn't deploy anything.

Solutions:

With help of a colleague and trouble shooting, we managed to set Bash as te default terminal and connect my Azure account to it.
