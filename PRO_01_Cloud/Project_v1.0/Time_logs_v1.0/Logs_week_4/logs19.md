# Daily report

Managed to create and deploy almost all the resources, except the admin server.
Asked my scrum master, Sinan to check with me incase I was missing something.

He was impressed and gave me the go ahead for the presentation for tomorrow.


# Obstacles

I wasn't able to deploy the last, admin server. couldn't fix the errors.

# Solutions

Made my presentation and decided to work onn the admin server in the morning before the presentation the next day.
