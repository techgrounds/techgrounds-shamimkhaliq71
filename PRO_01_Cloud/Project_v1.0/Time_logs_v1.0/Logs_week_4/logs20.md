# Daily report

We met as group on Techgrounds location at Bijlmerdreef 95.
Shikha, Vincent and Micha couldn't be present, but the rest was there.

It was nice to seee eachother face2face

I had to present my final of v1.0

# Obstacles

Unfortunatly, I couldn't fix some errors and was not able to show my full deployment.

# Solution

I did do my presentation and explained my personal experience of v1.0, without showing my deployments.
Received some good feedback, Casper told me to move forward to v1.1 and not stay stuck on v1.0
