Daily report

Feeling good. The guys are checking more with me if I need help, but I'm doing fine.
Created resource group, storageaccount.bicep, 
Main.bicep and parameters.bicep files and managed to link them properly and deployed succesfully to Azure.

Obstacles

There were 10 problems detected and I managed to fixed them all and deploy succesfully.

Solution

Just believe in yourself and keep trying things. 
More little breaks in between to see clearly again.
