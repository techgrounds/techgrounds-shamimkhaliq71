# Network Devices

Networking hardware, also known as network equipment or computer networking devices, are electronic devices which are required for communication and interaction between devices on a computers network. They play a crucial role in connecting devices, facilitating data transmission, and managing network traffic.

**Router**: Routes data packets between different networks, enabling communication between devices in separate networks.
**Switch**: Connects multiple devices within a network, allowing them to communicate with each other. It forwards data to the intended recipient based on their MAC address.
**Firewall**: Protects a network by monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
**Modem**: Converts digital data into a format suitable for transmission over a specific communication medium, such as a telephone line or cable line.
**Access Point**: Enables wireless devices to connect to a wired network, providing wireless network coverage within a certain range.
**Network Interface Card (NIC)**: An expansion card or integrated component that allows a device to connect to a network. It provides a unique MAC address for device identification.
**Repeater**: Extends the range of a network by amplifying and regenerating signals, ensuring that data can reach devices in areas with weak connectivity. These devices work together to establish and maintain network connections, ensure efficient data transfer, and enhance network security.

### Ervaren problemen
I couldn't log in onto my home router, because I didn't have the login details of the router, my son had those. I was trying to login with the password of my provider, and obviously that didn't work.
