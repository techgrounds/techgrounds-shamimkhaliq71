# IP adressing

An IP address serves two main purposes: network identification and location addressing. It provides a way to identify and differentiate devices on a network and allows them to communicate with each other.
IP addresses come in two versions:
 IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4): 
IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers expressed in the form of four sets of decimal numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.0.1). 
IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):
IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numbers expressed in hexadecimal format with groups of numbers and letters separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
IP addresses are essential for routing data packets across the internet and ensuring proper communication between devices. They enable devices to send and receive data by identifying the source and destination of the information being transmitted.


## Key-terms

IP: An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label such as 192.0.2.1 that is connected to a computer network that uses the internet protocol for communication.

IPv4 en IPv6: Two versions of IP

Public IP Address:
A public IP address is a unique address assigned to a device by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) to communicate with other devices over the internet. It is globally routable and can be accessed from anywhere on the internet. Public IP addresses are used to identify devices on the public internet and enable them to send and receive data across different networks. Examples of public IP addresses are like the address assigned to your home router by your ISP.

Private IP Address:
A private IP address is an address assigned to devices within a private network, such as a home or business network. Private IP addresses are used for local communication within the network and are not accessible from the public internet. They provide a way to identify and communicate with devices within a private network without exposing them directly to the internet. Private IP addresses can be reused within different private networks since they are not globally unique.

NAT: NAT stands for Network Address Translation. It is a process used in computer networking to translate IP addresses between different network domains. NAT allows devices within a private network to share a single public IP address when communicating with devices on the internet.

Static IP adress: Static means constant. Static. Stand. Stable. A static IP address doesn’t change unless you change it yourself.

Dynamic IP adress: Dynamic means “constantly changing.” The prefix dyna- means power, but dynamic IP addresses aren’t more powerful. They can simply change from time to time.

## Opdracht

- Ontdek wat je publieke IP adres is van je laptop en mobiel op wifi. Zijn de adressen hetzelfde of niet? Leg uit waarom.

IP addresses are not the same, because they are connected to different networks. (see screenshot)

- Ontdek wat je privé IP adres is van je laptop en mobiel op wifi. Zijn de adressen hetzelfde of niet? Leg uit waarom.
They are different IP adresses, same as above they are connected to different networks.

- Verander het privé IP adres van je mobiel naar dat van je laptop. Wat gebeurt er dan?

After changing my phone's IP to that of my laptop, I still had internet,but it was verly slow, however on my router my phone was not visible anymore.
And after changing it back, it was visible on the router and internet was fast again.

- Probeer het privé IP adres van je mobiel te veranderen naar een adres buiten je netwerk. Wat gebeurt er dan?

If, I try to change the private IP address of my mobile phone to an address outside my network, my mobile phone will most likely not be able to connect to the network. The IP address is outside the range of the subnet of the local network. This can result in the inability to send or receive data over the network and the loss of internet connectivity on my mobile phone.
