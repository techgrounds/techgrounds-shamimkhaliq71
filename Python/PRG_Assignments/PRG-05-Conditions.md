Exercise 1:

Create a new script.
Use the input() function to ask the user of your script for their name. If the name they input is your name, print a personalized welcome message. If not, print a different personalized message.

Example output:

![Alt text](../../00_includes/Python/Conditions/Conditions1.jpg)

Result output:

![Alt text](../../00_includes/Python/Conditions/User_input1.jpg)


Exercise 2:

Create a new script.
Ask the user of your script for a number. Give them a response based on whether the number is higher than, lower than, or equal to 100.
Make the game repeat until the user inputs 100.

Example output:

![Alt text](../../00_includes/Python/Conditions/Conditions2.jpg)

Result output:

![Alt text](../../00_includes/Python/Conditions/User_input2.jpg)
