# Key-value pairs
Introduction:
Key-value pairs are a general concept you will definitely encounter. Some examples of where you will find them are NoSQL databases or AWS/Azure resource tags. Dictionaries (dict) in Python also use key-value pairs to store information.

Dicts in Python are written using curly brackets {}. You can get values from the dict by calling its key. 

Requirements:

My output:

![Alt text](<../../00_includes/Python/Key-value pairs/Dictionary_result1.jpg>)

Exercise 2:
Create a new script.
Use user input to ask for their information (first name, last name, job title, company). Store the information in a dictionary.
Write the information to a csv file (comma-separated values). The data should not be overwritten when you run the script multiple times.

My output:
