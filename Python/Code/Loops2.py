# Create a new script.

# Copy the code below into your script.

# for i in range(10):
	# do something here

# Print the value of i in the for loop. 
# You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.
# range is 0 to 9. Counts upwards from 0 till 9, which gives 10 counts.


# Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.

x = 5

for i in range(10):
    print(i)
    

    # Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.

# Zev's example:

for i in range(0, 55, 5):
        print(i)

    
# Kaman's example:

for i in range(50):
    print(i * x)


# Marcel's example:

for i in range(1, 51):
    print(x * i)
