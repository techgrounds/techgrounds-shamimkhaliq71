# NTW OSI Stacks

The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a model primarily used for troubleshooting of telecommunication or computing systems. The OSI stack has 7 layers, each representing a different component of network communications. Each layer has different protocols associated with it. When troubleshooting an IT issue, you can use the OSI model as a reference point, by taking a bottom-up or a top-down approach. For example, you might start at layer 1 by checking if all cables are connected and all devices are turned on.

An alternative to the OSI model is the TCP/IP model. The TCP/IP model describes the standard on which the internet was built, so it is a more realistic model. OSI is generally more practical for troubleshooting purposes because of its extra layers, even if it isnâ€™t entirely accurate.
The OSI model helps network device manufacturers and networking software vendors: Create devices and software that can communicate with products from any other vendor, allowing open interoperability. Define which parts of the network their products should work with.

TCP/IP Model helps you to determine how a specific computer should be connected to the internet and how data should be transmitted between them. It helps you to create a virtual network when multiple computer networks are connected together. The purpose of TCP/IP model is to allow communication over large distances.

TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol. TCP/IP Stack is specifically designed as a model to offer highly reliable and end-to-end byte stream over an unreliable internetwork. The functionality of the TCP IP model is divided into four layers, and each includes specific protocols.

TCP/IP is a layered server architecture system in which each layer is defined according to a specific function to perform. All these four TCP IP layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one layer to another.

### Ervaren problemen

Geen problemen met reseach, misschien een beetje met het begrijpen van termen.

### Resultaat

I have learned the following: The OSI and TCP/IP models are both models that divide the operation of a network into layers, each having its own set of functions. While the OSI model is purely a theoretical model, the TCP/IP model is a description of the practical implementation.

Overlap:

Both models have a clear overlap where the layers of the OSI model fit within multiple layers of the TCP/IP model.The OSI model and the TCP/IP model have layers that share similar functions and responsibilities. These layers in the OSI model align with multiple layers in the TCP/IP model. This relationship is shown visually in a diagram.
