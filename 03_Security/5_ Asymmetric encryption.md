# Asymmetric encryption

The previous assignment introduced you to cryptography and symmetric encryption. In the previous exercise, you shared your encryption key with the recipient of your message. This means that anyone who has the key can decrypt the message.

Asymmetric encryption solves this issue. Instead of 1 key, you get 2: A public key, and a private key


## Key-terms

- Encryption: Encryption takes plain text, like a text message or email, and scrambles it into an unreadable format — called “cipher text.” This helps protect the confidentiality of digital data either stored on computer systems or transmitted  through a network like the Internet. 

- Decryption: reverse process of encryption, which involves converting ciphertext back into plaintext using a decryption algorithm and a secret key.

- Asymmetric encryption: uses two keys for encryption and decryption. A public key, which is shared among users, encrypts the data. A private key, which is not shared, decrypts the data. 

- Symmetric: encryption uses a single password to encrypt and decrypt data.

- Key:  it locks (encrypts) data so that only someone with the right key can unlock (decrypt) it. It tells you how to arrange the Cipher rules.

- Cipher: also called encryption algorithms, are systems for encrypting and decrypting data. A cipher converts the original message, called plaintext, into ciphertext using a key to determine how it is done.
Ciphers are generally categorized according to how they work and by how their key is used for encryption and decryption.
A ciphir is a set of rules you are using to encode the information.

## Opdracht

Requirments for this assigment:
The Slack channel you share with your entire cohort
A peer to send the message too via the public Slack channel.
A key pair generator like https://travistidwell.com/jsencrypt/demo/

- Generate a key pair.
- Send an asymmetrically encrypted message to one of your peers via the public Slack channel. They should be able to decrypt the message using a key. The recipient should be able to read the message, but it should remain a secret to everyone else. You are not allowed to use any private messages or other communication channels besides the public Slack channel. 
- Analyse the difference between this method and symmetric encryption.
