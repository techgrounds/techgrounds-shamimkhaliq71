# [Working with text (CLI)]
[Every command in Linux has a standard input and output. Both the input and output can be redirected to a file instead of the default. This is called input redirection and output redirection_3]

## Key-terms
[The standard input (stdin) is the keyboard] 
[Linux, ssh, PKI, Whoami, pwd, cd, ls, echo, Redirection, grep, cat, type, findstr]

## Opdracht
[Use the echo command and output redirection to write a new sentence into your text file using the command line. The new sentence should contain the word ‘techgrounds’.
Use a command to write the contents of your text file to the terminal. Make use of a command to filter the output so that only the sentence containing ‘techgrounds’ appears.
Read your text file with the command used in the second step, once again filtering for the word ‘techgrounds’. This time, redirect the output to a new file called ‘techgrounds.txt’.]
